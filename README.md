# CS367 Course Summary

This is the course summary of all the material used in UW-Madison Spring 2019 courses CS367 and Prof. Fisher is the instructor of this courses.

And this CS367 is the final time UW-Madison offered and according to my personal experience I think this course is the most valuable courses of CS Department in UW-Madison. Nearly all the materials including Slides, Readings, Homework and Projects are the best since 50 years' improvement.

I strongly recommend reading all the PDF in the [reading] folder. They are fantastic.
